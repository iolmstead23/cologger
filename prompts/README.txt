  CoLogger Prompt Templates - User Guide
==============================================

WHAT ARE PROMPT TEMPLATES?
--------------------------
Prompt templates are pre-written instructions that guide the AI's log analysis focus.
Each template emphasizes different aspects of log analysis.

HOW TO USE:
-----------
1. Run CoLogger and select "Analyze Logs & Generate Report"
2. You'll be prompted to select a template before analysis begins
3. Choose from available templates or use the default
4. Optionally add custom instructions to fine-tune the analysis

CREATING YOUR OWN TEMPLATES:
----------------------------
1. Create a new .txt file in this folder
2. Name it descriptively (e.g., "database-troubleshooting.txt")
3. Write your prompt instructions in plain text
4. The filename will appear in the menu (e.g., "Database Troubleshooting")

TIPS:
-----
- Be specific about what you want the AI to focus on
- Templates work best when they're 2-5 sentences
- You can always add custom text when running analysis
- The default prompt is always available as a fallback

INCLUDED TEMPLATES:
-------------------
- Security Focus: Emphasizes security events and vulnerabilities
- Performance Analysis: Focuses on performance bottlenecks and resource issues
- Error Tracking: Prioritizes errors, exceptions, and failure patterns
